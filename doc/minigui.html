<title>The ELKI MiniGUI</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>MiniGUI invocation</h1>
<p>ELKI comes with a simple GUI that helps with parameterization by
offering input assistance.</p>
<p>Since release 0.3, the GUI is the default operation when
launching the .jar file:</p>
<pre>java -jar mypath/elki.jar</pre>

<p>The main purpose of the ELKI MiniGUI is to help new users with
ELKI invocation. As such, it can be seen as a <em>command line
builder</em>. But it has some convenience functions that make it a very
convenient part of ELKI.</p>

<h2>MiniGUI initial screen</h2>

	alt="ELKI MiniGUI initial screen" />
<p>After launching the ELKI MiniGUI, you will be greeted with a
screen similar to this. The screen is separated into three main parts.
At the top, you will find a table containing the currently available
parameters. The MiniGUI has some input assistance, which will be
detailed below.</p>
<p>In the middle there is an input field for <em>Saved Settings</em>,
along with buttons to save, load and remove saved settings. On the very
right, you will also find the <em>Run button</em>, which will invoke
this task.</p>
<p>Below this is the logging pane. Errors and verbose output will be
shown here. Occasionally, you will also see a progress bar at the bottom
of this pane. In the screenshot above, you see the error reported for
the missing <code>-algorithm</code> Parameter.</p>

<h2>The parameter table</h2>

<img src="figures/minigui-input-assistance.png"
	alt="ELKI MiniGUI input assistance" />

<p>For some parameters, namely <em>Class parameters</em>, <em>Boolean
flags</em> and <em>File parameters</em>, the MiniGUI will offer you input
assistance, for example by providing a drop-down menu with known
implementations or a file selector.</p>

<p>The parameter table <em>changes dynamically</em>. In this
screenshot, the DBSCAN algorithm was selected, causing the "epsilon" and
"minpts" Parameters of DBSCAN to appear as additional required options.</p>

<p><em>Colors</em> give an indication of the current state: orange
indicates a missing value. Grey values are mandatory but have a default
value. Green values are optional.</p>

<h2>Saved Settings</h2>

<p>In order to save a setting, you need to first type a <em>name</em>
of the setting into the input field, then press Save. You should then
find it in the dropdown menu until you remove it again.</p>

<p>The saved settings functionality uses a file named <code>MiniGUI-saved-settings.txt</code>
in the invocation directory to store previous setups. Settings are
separated by an empty line, the first line of each setting is the name,
the remaining lines make up the parameter list.</p>

<h2>Visualization</h2>

<img src="figures/elki-visualizations.png" alt="ELKI Visualizations" />

<p>This release of ELKI also includes a growing visualizations
framework. Among the results that can be visualized are <em>Outlier
Scores</em>, <em>Clustering results</em>, <em>Histograms</em>, <em>ROC
Curves</em>, <em>OPTICS plots</em> and <em>Index MBRs</em>.</p>

<p>To enable visualizations, set the <code>-resulthandler</code>
Parameter to <code>de.lmu.ifi.dbs.elki.visualization.gui.ResultVisualizer</code>
(Note: this can also be used outside of MiniGUI). Appropriate
Visualizers will be chosen when the algorithm has run; so not all of the
offered parameters in the table will be in use.</p>

<p>The visualization area is composed of four areas. At the left,
you will see various unprojected visualizers. These range from a cluster
key, score histograms to the settings the task was invoked with. At the
top, you will see 1-dimensional projections such as value distribution
histograms. Below this, you will see 2-dimensional projections that may
be an overlay of multiple visualizations. There will also be a single
3-dimensional projection for the first three dimensions.</p>

<p>This example screenshot shows normalized LOF outlier scores
visualized as bubbles along with a score histogram on the left.</p>
